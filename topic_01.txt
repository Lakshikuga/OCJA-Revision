An object is a runtime instance of a class in memory. Represents state of your program.

Java classes have 2 primary elements : fields and methods. Together these are called members of the class. 
Variables/fields hold the state of the program and methods operate on that state.
Java calls a word with special meaning as KEYWORD.
A method is an operation that can be called.
The full declaration of a method is known as the method signature.
void means that no value at all is returned.
information be supplied to it from the calling method, this info is called a parameter.

1. java does not require a class to be public.
2.You can even put two classes in the same file. When you do so, at most one of the classes in the file is allowed to be public.
can put 2 classes in the same file. when doing so, only one class in the file is allowed to be public. 
3. also if you do have a public class, it needs to match the filename.


Rules
========================
Each file can contain only one class.
The filename must match the class name, including case, and have a .java exension.

u cn write the parameter of main() like these:

1. String[] args
2. String args[]
3. String...args ---> varargs (variable argument lists)

Import statements tell Java which packages to look in for classes.

Java only looks for class names in the package.
